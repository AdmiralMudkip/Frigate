# Frigate

This is a JavaScript memory game that a group of five (see 'one person') made as a school project.  

It's mostly broken.  It's highscores work (I just checked, surprisingly enough the Heroku server and the MongoLab database are still up and running.),
it's mouse kinda works, but it's buttons work and the game functions.

I'll probably try to update it a bit over the winter break, although I'll probably look back on this and laugh.
